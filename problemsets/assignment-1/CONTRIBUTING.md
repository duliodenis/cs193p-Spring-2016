# How to Contribute

## Post an Issue

If you discover a bug or error, please [add an issue](https://github.com/duliodenis/cs193p-Spring-2016/issues) here on GitHub. Feature requests are welcome. However, I am a one-man band, so pull requests are preferred.


## Create a Pull Request

Fork the project, create a branch, commit your changes, and then create a pull request. Please submit your pull request to the **develop** branch of this repository.

The **master** branch is for production-ready content and should not contain incomplete features. Development occurs on the **develop** branch. Once your pull request is accepted, it will be merged into **master**.
